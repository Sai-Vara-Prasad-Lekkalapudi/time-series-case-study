The LSTM model tracks the observed series more closely and produces a more moderate long-range forecast with narrower uncertainty bounds.

### Comparative Interpretation
According to the report, the LSTM substantially outperforms ARIMA on this dataset because:

- oil prices exhibit **nonlinear dynamics**,
- the series includes **trend reversals**,
- volatility is not constant,
- ARIMA is limited by its linear structure,
- LSTM can better capture temporal dependencies and nonlinear patterns.


## Key Findings

- The oil price series is **non-stationary** in its original form.
- ARIMA provides a useful statistical benchmark but struggles with structural change.
- Residual diagnostics indicate that ARIMA does not fully capture the dependence structure.
- LSTM gives much better predictive accuracy on the reported test set.
- The 24-month forecasts from the two models differ substantially in shape and uncertainty.
- For this dataset, the report concludes that **LSTM is the more realistic forecasting model**.

## Main Libraries Used

Typical Python libraries for this project include:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn` or equivalent plotting tools
- `statsmodels`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` / `keras`


## Limitations

The report also acknowledges several limitations:

- the analysis is based on a **univariate** series only,
- important exogenous drivers such as macroeconomic variables and geopolitical events are not included,
- ARIMA and LSTM use different data framing strategies, so comparisons should be interpreted carefully,
- uncertainty in long-horizon forecasting remains substantial,
- oil markets are influenced by real-world structural breaks that are difficult to capture fully.


## Future Work

Recommended extensions from the report include:

- **ARIMAX** with exogenous variables,
- **multivariate LSTM**,
- **hybrid ARIMA–LSTM models**,
- **GARCH-family volatility models**,
- **forecast combination methods**,
- **transformer-based forecasting models** such as Temporal Fusion Transformers.
